"""
TODO
====

* Test with AstroPy's Cutout2D tool?
* Add test for treatment of optional fsspec dependency.
* Review subset docstring
* Review NumPy array subclassing, e.g. https://github.com/seung-lab/cloud-volume
* Verify it works with http:// urls.

* Add indexing tests with specified dimensions, e.g.:
    (0,1) or ((0,1), (2,3))
  first number in each tuple is the dimension.
* Add indexing tests with newaxis at the front, e.g.:
    (None, None, 0),
    (None, None, slice(None)),
* Review all the indexing patterns listed at https://numpy.org/devdocs/user/basics.indexing.html
